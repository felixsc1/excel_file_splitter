# Excel File Splitter

Simple GUI to split large excel files.


## Usage
- Select the input .xlsx file
- Specify number of rows in each output file (not including header row)
- Specify a suffix for the output files (e.g. "{number}_split" will result in "original_filename_001_split.xlsx" etc.)

Output files are generated in the same folder as the original file.
